/* ConsoleStatusUpdater.cs
 * 
 * PROGRAMMER:    Jeffrey T. Darlington
 * DATE:          August 20, 2009
 * PROJECT:       WinHasher core library
 * .NET VERSION:  2.0
 * REQUIRES:      See using statements
 * REQUIRED BY:   All WinHasher programs
 * 
 * This very simple class provides us with a means of passing updates to the Windows console
 * for command-line versions of the WinHasher programs (hash, md5, and sha1).  An object of this
 * class can be passed into certain methods of the HashEngine class.  When present, the HashEngine
 * will print out the percentage complete of its progress to the Console, similar to the progress
 * bar used in the GUI app but as a textual number ("95%").
 * 
 * It is assumed that when this is called, an initial status will be displayed such as:
 * 
 *    Computing SHA-1 of C:\some_file.zip...   0%
 * 
 * The ConsoleStatusUpdater replace in place the "  0%" string with the updated percentage
 * complete, ensuring that no extra lines are needed.  Note the extra spaces in front of the
 * zero in the sample; this object assumes it will overwrite the last four characters, meaning
 * three characters for the number (up to 100) plus the percent sign.
