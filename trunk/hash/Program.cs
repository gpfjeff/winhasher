/* Program.cs
 * 
 * PROGRAMMER:    Jeffrey T. Darlington
 * DATE:          August 31, 2007
 * PROJECT:       WinHasher console application
 * .NET VERSION:  2.0
 * REQUIRES:      com.gpfcomics.WinHasher.Core
 * REQUIRED BY:   (None)
 * 
 * The command-line version of WinHasher.  This console app computes the hash of one or more files.
 * In single file mode, it prints out the hash to the screen.  In multi-file mode, it compares the
 * hash of each file to the hashes of the others:  if all match, all the files are said to be the
 * same; if one or more do not match, the entire batch fails.  Which hash algorithm to use is
 * specified as the first argument switch; if no algorithm is specified, MD5 is the default.
 * This is supposed to be roughly compatible to something like OpenSSL's command-line digest
 * options.  See the usage method for details on using this program.
 * 
 * UPDATE June 19, 2008 (1.3):  Added -base64 switch and Base64 output option.
 *
 * UPDATE February 12, 2009 (1.4):  Added -hexcaps switch and all-caps hexadcimal output, as well
 * as -bubbab and Bubble Babble.
 * 
 * 1.5:  No changes to the console apps in this version; version number bumped just to keep in
 * step with the GUI app.
 * 
 * UPDATE August 20, 2009 (1.6):  Added usage of WinHasherCore.ConsoleStatusUpdater to update
 * the console with the current percent complete.
 * 
 * UPDATE June 28, 2011 (1.7):  Updates to address Issue 2, "Output redirection".  Used newly
 * rebuilt core library to do the heavy lifting.  Most of the new logic can be found in
 * WinHasherCore.CmdLineAppUtils.
