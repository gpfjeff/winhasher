/* JTD: The following text has been added has been added to force TortoiseSVN's
   SubWCRev command to update the AssemblyInfo.cs templates with the appropriate
   revision number.  Undoubtedly, this only works when the tempalte itself is
   modified, although we want it to occur when any code changes.  So just before
   doing a release build, make sure to change the random string below to some-
   thing new to force SubWCRev to add the new info.
