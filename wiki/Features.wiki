#summary Features of WinHasher
#labels Phase-Support

= Features =

 * Two primary interfaces: A small Windows GUI applet and a console (command line) program
 * Three primary operating modes: Compute the hash of a single file, compare the contents of multiple files by comparing the hash of each one, or hash arbitrary text
 * Supported hashing algorithms: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 MD5], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions SHA-1], SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD RIPEMD-160], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_%28cryptography%29 Whirlpool] (2003 revision), and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_%28hash%29 Tiger] (1995 original, not "Tiger2")
 * Supported output formats: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal Hexadecimal] (with either lower-case or upper-case letters), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 Base64], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Babble Bubble Babble]
 * Windows applet supports drag-and-drop functionality; automatically compute the hash of a single file by dropping it onto the applet, or drop one or more files to add them to the compare list
 * Optional "Send To" shortcuts allow you to right-click any file in Windows Explorer and instantly get its hash, or right-click multiple files to compare their contents
 * Long running processes (such as hashing an individual very large file or comparing the hashes of many files) can now be cancelled when running in GUI mode
 * Remembers last used settings such as hash algorithm, output format, last folder/directory, mode tab, etc.
 * Can hash a total amount of data in one process up to 8.05EB (exabytes)!
