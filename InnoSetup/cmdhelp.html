<a name="whywinhasher"><h3>Why WinHasher?</h3></a>

<p>Cryptographic hashing is readily available on many computer operating systems. It often comes built-in to the OS or as a (relatively) standard optional package. Mac OS, Linux, Free/OpenBSD, and many other OSes include <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> as either a pre-installed or easily installable optional component. OpenSSL includes several command-line components for generating cryptographic hashes and there are number of graphical user interface (GUI) applications that allow point-and-click access to its capabilities.</p>
<p>Not so with Microsoft Windows. Windows does not include any built-in utilities for cryptographic hashes, and installing and using OpenSSL on Windows is not a trivial matter. The typical Windows user of today is much less familiar with the Windows Console (i.e. command line) let alone compiling software from source. And while cryptographic hashes are pretty much standard in programming libraries such as those in Microsoft's .NET, the user is required to write and compile their own applications to use them.</p>
<p>This "hashing divide" has annoyed me for some time. While I consider myself to be an operating system agnostic and find myself equally home on both Windows and Linux, there are many times I've downloaded Windows-only software but didn't have the capability to verify the file's hash. Either I've been unable to install and run OpenSSL on a given machine, or I haven't had the time or access to a Linux box to copy the file over, generate the hash, and verify it before install. So I wanted to create a quick, simple, easy-to-use Windows app so I could get the hash of a file without waiting or moving it around. I also thought it would be a nice idea to be able to quickly compare the hashes of multiple files without having to generate each one and manually check every hexadecimal digit, so I added that functionality too. After writing the program, I thought it might be useful to others, so I decided to share.</p>

<p>It should be noted that cryptographic hashes and digests do <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> guarantee authenticity or ownership of digital files. Hashes and digests should <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> be confused with digital signatures, which verify both file integrity and the authenticity of the file's creator. Hashes and digests <em><strong>ONLY</strong></em> guarantee that the file has not been altered or corrupted in transit, and it is trivial for a hacker to alter both a file and the displayed hash if a remote site is hacked. If both integrity and authenticity are required, please use an application such as <a href="http://www.pgp.com/">PGP</a> or <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> to create and/or verify digital signatures.</p>
<p>After releasing WinHasher, it came to my attention that there already exists a separate WinHasher application that performs a similar function. This application is unrelated to the other application by the same name and was independently developed. I make no claims of trademark on the name "WinHasher" and from my understanding, neither has the other application's developer. Since my application came second, I will happily defer and rename my WinHasher if the other developer asserts ownership of the name. However, since names can mean a great deal in today's world of search engines, I will continue to use the name unless explicitly asked to change it by the other application's developer. You can find the other WinHasher by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=WinHasher">searching for "WinHasher" at Google</a> and going to any of the shareware/freeware download sites listed. My WinHasher is currently only available at the <a href="https://github.com/gpfjeff/winhasher">GitHub project page</a>.</p>

<a name="hash"><h3>The <code>hash</code> program</h3></a>

<p>The primary console program for WinHasher is <code>hash.</code> Run without any arguments, <code>hash</code> will display a somewhat standard usage statement:</p>

Usage: hash [-md5|-sha1|-sha-224|-sha-256|-sha-384|-sha-512|-ripemd128|-ripemd160|
        -ripemd256|-ripemd320|-whirlpool|-tiger|-gost3411|-sha3-224|-sha3-256
        -sha3-384|-sha3-512]
        [-hex|-hexcaps|-base64|-bubbab] [-compare] [-out outfile [-append]]
        [-in infile | filename1 [filename2 ...]]

WinHasher is a command-line cryptographic hash generator for files.  It
runs in one of two modes:  file hashing and multi-file comparison.  If the
"-compare" switch is supplied, compare mode is active; otherwise, multiple
input files will be hashed individually and the result for each displayed.

In hashing mode, WinHasher computes the cryptographic hash of the given
file(s) and prints it to the screen in mode similar to the UNIX md5sum,
shasum, and related commands.  With no command-line switches, it computes
the SHA-256 hash and displays it in hexadecimal format.  Various switches
allow you to change to other hashing algorithms, such as MD5, the SHA
family, RIPEMD-160, WHIRLPOOL, and TIGER.  The "-base64" switch causes
WinHasher to output hashes in MIME Base64 (RFC 2045) format rather than
hexadecimal, "-hexcaps" outputs hexadecimal with all capital letters,
and "-bubbab" uses Bubble Babble encoding.  If multiple files are
specified, each file is hashed in turn and the result displayed.

In multi-file comparison mode, WinHasher computes the specified hash for
each file given and compares the results.  If the hash of every file
matches, then all files in the batch are declared to be the same.  If
one or more hashes do not match the others, a warning will be displayed
indicating as such.  In this way, you can determine whether two or more
files share the same contents despite file name, path, and modification
time differences.

The result of the either operation can be sent to a file by using the
"-out" switch followed by a path to the file.  If you also supply the
"-append" switch, the result will be appended to the end of the file;
otherwise, the file will be overwritten if it already exists.

You may also specify the list of files to hash or compare by listing
them in a simple text file and using the "-in" switch, followed by the
path to the file.  Input files should have the path to each file listed
on a separate line.  Leading and trailing white space will be ignored, as
will any blank lines or lines that contain only white space.  You may place
comments in this file by starting a line with the pound or hash (#)
character; any line that starts with this character will also be ignored.</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>hash</code> expects at least one command-line argument: a file to compute a hash for. If you supply a file name as an argument, <code>hash</code> will by default compute the SHA-1 hash of the file and return a hexadecimal representation of it:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash C:\some\path\to\somefile.jpg

13dde34a8ebfb13ee2877114f7d6072be249fe4b  somefile.jpg</pre></blockquote>
<p><span class="alert">Note that this default behavior has changed from previous versions of <code>hash</code>!</span> Versions prior to 1.4 displayed the MD5 hash of the file; prior to version 1.7, it displayed the hash algorithm, not the name of the file. The new format is more in line with well-known UNIX utilities such as <code>md5sum</code> and <code>shasum</code>. If you are using <code>hash</code> as part of a script, please update your code to take these changes into account.</p>
<p>If the file's path contains spaces, you must include the entire path in double quotes:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash "C:\This path has spaces\somefile.jpg"

13dde34a8ebfb13ee2877114f7d6072be249fe4b  somefile.jpg</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you specify multiple files on the command-line, <code>hash</code> computes and displays the hash of each individual file. <span class="alert">Note that this default behavior has changed from previous versions of <code>hash</code>!</span> Prior to version 1.7, specifying multiple files put <code>hash</code> into comparison mode. We'll get to comparison mode in a moment.</p>

<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash file1.jpg file2.jpg

13dde34a8ebfb13ee2877114f7d6072be249fe4b  file1.jpg
ed4277cc0e49cef5c5caef97c5747aa521ee2e00  file2.jpg</pre></blockquote>

<p>To compare two or more files, you must now specify the <code>-compare</code> parameter. The hash (SHA-1 by default) for each file is computed individually, then all the hashes are compared. If the hashes of every file specified are equal, then all the files are said to match:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -compare file1.jpg file2.jpg

Comparing SHA-1 of 2 files... 100%
Congratulations!  All 2 files match!</pre></blockquote>

<p>However, if at least one file in the batch does <em>not</em> match the others, then the <em>entire batch</em> fails the test. So it's an all-or-nothing comparison:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -compare file1.jpg file2.doc

Comparing SHA-1 of 2 files... 100%
WARNING! One or more of these 2 files do not match!</pre></blockquote>
<p>To change which hashing algorithm to use, supply the appropriate algorithm switch as the <em>first</em> command-line argument. So for SHA-256:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -sha256 somefile.jpg

fd2bd0df5427c2adadcd14ed20472d85cef05a85e91338c31487019960a0cd44  somefile.jpg</pre></blockquote>
<p>The algorithm switch consists of a hyphen (not a slash, which is the standard Windows command-line switch prefix, because it's always my <em>hope</em> to support other platforms) followed by the algorithm name in all lower case. Any punctuation (like the hyphens for the SHA family) are dropped. If you're ever in doubt on what a switch for a particular algorithm is, just run <code>hash</code> with no arguments to get the usage text. The algorithm switches will be listed and should be pretty easy to figure out.</p>
<p>To generate hash output in MIME Base64 rather than hexadecimal, include the <code>-base64</code> switch. The following produces the SHA-1 hash of a file in Base64 format:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -base64 somefile.jpg

YuWAXOl2EayIU3U8nk89f77AQes=  somefile.jpg</pre></blockquote>
<p>The Base64 switch can be combined with any hash algorithm switch. The order of the two switches is unimportant, but all switches <em>must</em> come before the list of files to hash. For example:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -sha256 -base64 somefile.jpg

/SvQ31Qnwq2tzRTtIEcthc7wWoXpEzjDFIcBmWCgzUQ=  somefile.jpg</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>hash -sha256 -base64</code> is equivalent to <code>hash -base64 -sha256</code>. While you can specify the Base64 switch on multi-file comparisons, it is silently ignored. It doesn't really matter whether the comparisons are made on strings of hexadecimal characters or strings of Base64 characters, just that the two strings either match or not.</p>
<p>In the same fashion, you can use the <code>-bubbab</code> switch to put the output in Bubble Babble format:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -bubbab somefile.jpg

ximiv-huboh-sypil-kegyp-sudoh-fituf-sulig-zezil-zozus-bubev-roxox  somefile.jpg</pre></blockquote>
<p>If the first argument is not a recognized switch (say, you made a typo and typed <code>hash -sha258</code>), an error message is displayed and the algorithm defaults to SHA-1, hexadecimal output. Then the first argument is treated as a file name, which may or may not be what you wanted. (In this example, "-sha258" is not likely to be a valid file name.)</p>
<p>The algorithm switch can, of course, be combined with <code>-compare</code> switch to compare multiple files using that hash. For example, to compare three files using RIPEMD-160:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -ripemd160 -compare file1.jpg file2.jpg file3.jpg

Comparing RIPEMD160 of 3 files...  65%
WARNING! One or more of these 3 files do not match!</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>hash</code> also supports reading a list of files from a file. This input file should be a plain text file consisting of a list file names, with one file per line. If the files are outside the current working directory or in different directories, the full path to the file may be required. As a convenience, empty lines or lines consisting of nothing by white space (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) are ignored, which can be handy when visually sorting or grouping the file list. Comments can be also be added by starting the line with the pound or hash character (#). Comments are also ignored. To feed <code>hash</code> an input file, replace the list of files to hash on the command line with the <code>-in</code> flag followed by the input file path:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -in testfiles.txt

62e5805ce97611ac8853753c9e4f3d7fbec041eb  file1.jpg
13dde34a8ebfb13ee2877114f7d6072be249fe4b  file2.doc
ed4277cc0e49cef5c5caef97c5747aa521ee2e00  file3.txt</pre></blockquote>
<p>If the <code>-in</code> flag is specified, you should not specify any additional files on the command line; these files will be ignored. Naturally, the <code>-in</code> flag can be combined with any of the other flags:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -sha256 -compare -in testfiles.txt

Comparing SHA-256 of 3 files...  65%
WARNING! One or more of these 3 files do not match!</pre></blockquote>
<p>You can redirect the output of <code>hash</code> to its own file by using the <code>-out</code> flag, followed by the name of the file to write the output to:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -out hashresults.txt file1.jpg file2.doc file3.txt</pre></blockquote>
<p>In the example above, the SHA-1 hash of the three files will be generated, encoded into hexadecimal format, and written to the file <code>hashresults.txt</code>. By default, the <code>-out</code> flag overwrites the specified file if it already exists. You can force <code>hash</code> to append to an existing output file by adding the <code>-append</code> flag:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -out hashresults.txt -append file1.jpg file2.doc file3.txt</pre></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, you can combine <code>-in</code> and <code>-out</code> with any other command line arguments:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>hash -sha512 -base64 -in testfiles.txt -out hashresults.txt -append</pre></blockquote>
<p>The above command reads a list of files from <code>testfiles.txt</code>, performs the SHA-512 hash on each, encodes those hashes to Base64, and writes the results to the file <code>hashresults.txt</code>, appending to the existing file if it already exists.</p>

<a name="batchfiles"><h3>A Matter of Convenience: Algorithm Batch Files</h3></a>

<p>As a convenience, I've also included Windows batch files as a "shortcut" for running specific hashes. There is one batch file for each algorithm, using the same name as the command line switch for the <code>hash</code> program. (For example, <code>md5</code> performs an MD5 hash, while <code>sha256</code> performs a SHA-256 hash.) Each batch file is equivalent to using the specified algorithm command line switch: Running <code>sha1</code> is same as running <code>hash -sha1</code>.</p>
<p>Aside from defaulting the algorithm, the batch files work identically to the main <code>hash</code> program. All of them accept the rest of the command-line switches. For example:</p>
<blockquote><pre>C:\Program Files\WinHasher>sha512 -base64 -in testfiles.txt -out hashresults.txt -append</pre></blockquote>
<p>The above command uses the <code>sha512</code> batch file, but will read the file list from an input file, use Base64 to encode the hashes, and append the output to the output file.</p>
