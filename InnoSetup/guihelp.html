<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<a name="coreconcepts"><h3>Core Concepts</h3></a>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>In cryptography, a <em>cryptographic hash function</em> is a transformation that takes an input and returns a fixed-size string, which is called the hash value. Hash functions with this property are used for a variety of computational purposes, including cryptography. The hash value is a concise representation of the longer message or document from which it was computed. The message digest is a sort of "digital fingerprint" of the larger document. Cryptographic hash functions are used to do message integrity checks and digital signatures in various information security applications, such as authentication and message integrity.</p>
<p>A hash function takes a long string (or "message") of any length as input and produces a fixed length string as output, sometimes termed a <em>message digest</em> or a <em>digital fingerprint.</em> A hash function (also called a "digest" or a "checksum") is a kind of "signature" for a stream of data that represents the contents. One analogy that explains the role of the hash function would be the "tamper-evident" seals used on a software package.</p>
<p>In various standards and applications, the two most-commonly used hash functions are MD5 and SHA-1.</p></blockquote>
<p>For more information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">look up "cryptographic hash function" on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>As described in the synopsis above, one of the primary uses of cryptographic hashes is to verify and validate computer software or digital files. It is common practice among many developers, especially in the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> community, to provide a hash of a file next to its download link. Once the user has downloaded the file, they can generate a hash using the same hashing algorithm on their own machine and compare this computed hash to the hash listed on the originating site. If the two hashes match, the user can then safely assume that (1) the downloaded file arrived intact and uncorrupted and (2) it has not been tampered with since the original hash displayed on the site was posted.</p>
<p>Note, however, that security experts will wisely caution that this does <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> guarantee the downloaded file is completely safe. A hacker or malicious system administrator could have easily modified the file after the developer posted it, recomputed the hash, and placed the modified file and hash in the original's place. It also does not guarantee that the file is free from viruses, trojans, or other malware that have infected the file before the hash was computed. Therefore, cryptographic hashes should be just one in a series of checks a user should perform before deciding that a file downloaded from the Internet is safe to use.</p>

<a name="whywinhasher"><h3>Why WinHasher?</h3></a>

<p>Cryptographic hashing is readily available on many computer operating systems. It often comes built-in to the OS or as a (relatively) standard optional package. Mac OS, Linux, Free/OpenBSD, and many other OSes include <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> as either a pre-installed or easily installable optional component. OpenSSL includes several command-line components for generating cryptographic hashes and there are number of graphical user interface (GUI) applications that allow point-and-click access to its capabilities.</p>
<p>Not so with Microsoft Windows. Windows does not include any built-in utilities for cryptographic hashes, and installing and using OpenSSL on Windows is not a trivial matter. The typical Windows user of today is much less familiar with the Windows Console (i.e. command line) let alone compiling software from source. And while cryptographic hashes are pretty much standard in programming libraries such as the Microsoft .NET Framework, the user is required to write and compile their own applications to use them.</p>
<p>This "hashing divide" has annoyed me for some time. While I consider myself to be an operating system agnostic and find myself equally home on both Windows and Linux, there are many times I've downloaded Windows-only software but didn't have the capability to verify the file's hash. Either I've been unable to install and run OpenSSL on a given machine, or I haven't had the time or access to a Linux box to copy the file over, generate the hash, and verify it before install. So I wanted to create a quick, simple, easy-to-use Windows app so I could get the hash of a file without waiting or moving it around. I also thought it would be a nice idea to be able to quickly compare the hashes of multiple files without having to generate each one and manually check every hexadecimal digit, so I added that functionality too. After writing the program, I thought it might be useful to others, so I decided to share.</p>

<a name="disclaimer"><h3>Disclaimers</h3></a>

<p>Please read the <a href="gpl.html">WinHasher license</a> for complete licensing information. WinHasher is released under the GNU General Public License version 2, which outlines information concerning its use, redistribution, and warranties. Please read this license fully before using this application.</p>
<p>It should be noted that cryptographic hashes and digests do <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> guarantee authenticity or ownership of digital files. Hashes and digests should <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> be confused with digital signatures, which verify both file integrity and the authenticity of the file's creator. Hashes and digests <em><strong>ONLY</strong></em> guarantee that the file has not been altered or corrupted in transit, and it is trivial for a hacker to alter both a file and the displayed hash if a remote site is hacked. If both integrity and authenticity are required, please use an application such as <a href="http://www.pgp.com/">PGP</a> or <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> to create and/or verify digital signatures.</p>
<p>After releasing WinHasher, it came to my attention that there already exists a separate WinHasher application that performs a similar function. This application is unrelated to the other application by the same name and was independently developed. I make no claims of trademark on the name "WinHasher" and from my understanding, neither has the other application's developer. Since my application came second, I will happily defer and rename my WinHasher if the other developer asserts ownership of the name. However, since names can mean a great deal in today's world of search engines, I will continue to use the name unless explicitly asked to change it by the other application's developer. You can find the other WinHasher by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=WinHasher">searching for "WinHasher" at Google</a> and going to any of the shareware/freeware download sites listed. My WinHasher is currently only available at the <a href="https://github.com/gpfjeff/winhasher">GitHub project page</a>.</p>

<a name="install"><h2>Installing WinHasher</h2></a>

<a name="nonwin"><h3>WinHasher Without the Win: Non-Windows Platforms</h3></a>

<p>One of the beauties about using .NET to develop WinHasher is that it's technically not restricted to Microsoft Windows. Microsoft has ported .NET (not the Winforms used in Winhasher's GUI) to a lot of platforms. As of Winhasher, <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> is a project which runs .NET client and server applications on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, Windows, and Unix. However, I do not plan to officially offer support for non-Windows use of WinHasher. Personally, I think there are much better tools already available for other OSes, and you'd be better off using those instead. Still, if you're a glutton for punishment, feel free to give it a try.</p>

<a name="portable"><h3>Portable WinHasher</h3></a>

<p>WinHasher can be run in a "portable mode" that allows it to be run without permanent installation. In portable mode, changes to the settings and options are not saved or preserved, and always revert to their defaults when the application launches. The advantage, of course, is that no "fingerprints" are left behind on the system whenever WinHasher is run; there is no cruft left behind in the system registry, or files left behind on the system.</p>
<p>In order to run WinHasher in portable mode, download the binaries-only package from our <a href="https://github.com/gpfjeff/winhasher">GitHub project page</a>, rather than the installer. Copy <em>all</em> of the files from that archive to your portable device (USB drive, optical disc, etc.) and keep them together; WinHasher will not work if it cannot find all of its support files. See <a href="#launch">Launching WinHasher</a> to see how to start WinHasher in portable mode.</p>
<p>WinHasher behaves slightly different when executed in portable mode:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>User preferences and settings are <em>not</em> saved. All settings revert to their defaults when WinHasher is launched.</li>
<li>The context menu "Send to" shortcuts will <em>not</em> be available and cannot be created. You can, however, drag-and-drop files onto the GUI app or specify the file(s) to hash on the GUI app or console app command lines.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>[ <a href="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a> ]</p>

<a name="using"><h2>Using WinHasher</h2></a>

<a name="launch"><h3>Launching WinHasher</h3></a>

<p>How you launch WinHasher depends on what options you installed. You can always launch WinHasher by going to the Start menu and navigating to the WinHasher group. Then just select the WinHasher menu item and it will start right up. If you chose to install a WinHasher icon on your desktop, you can also double-click that icon to launch it.</p>
<p>To launch WinHasher in portable mode, you will need to add the "-portable" flag to its command line. You can do this by either bringing up a command prompt and typing it in:</p>
<blockquote><pre>Z:\Path\To\WinHasher\On\Drive&gt; WinHasher.exe -portable</pre></blockquote>
<p>or by creating a shortcut and adding "-portable" (sans quotes) in the Target field.</p>
<p>When WinHasher opens, it creates a small window with three tabs and a series of common controls. The tabs represent the three main functions of WinHasher, while the common controls apply to the program as a whole. When started in portable mode, the text "(Portable)" appears in the window's title bar after the version number.</p>

<a name="commongui"><h3>Common Controls</h3></a>

<p>At the bottom of the WinHasher window is a series of common controls that apply to all functional tabs. The most important of these controls is the <strong>Hash drop-down list</strong>. This drop-down allows you to select which cryptographic hash to perform in the next operation. There are <a href="#hashes">a number of hashes available</a> in WinHasher; which hash you use is up to you. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. However, if you are planning to validate a downloaded file, you'll want to select the same hash as the one used by the file's site online. If generating hashes for your own purposes, try to take into account the various caveats when choosing an algorithm to use.</p>
<p>Beneath the hash drop-down is the <strong>Output Format drop-down list</strong>. By default, WinHasher outputs hashes in lower-case hexadecimal format, which is the most popular way of displaying hashes. However, <a href="#output">several other options are available</a>. If you prefer the letters of your hex format to be upper-case (A-F) rather than lower case (a-f), choose "Hex (Caps)". Other options include Base64 and Bubble Babble. Your choice of output format is a personal preference, of course, and which you use is entirely up to you. As with hash algorithms, use the same output format as the original when validating downloaded files, and your personal preference for your own uses.</p>
<p>To the right of to the Hash drop-down is the <strong>About button</strong>. This button displays another window that shows the version number, copyright and license information, and (if this file is present) a button to launch this help file. Below the About button and to the right of the Output Format drop-down is the <strong>Close button</strong>, which oddly enough closes WinHasher. WinHasher can also be closed by the standard Close button in the title bar or by the standard Windows Alt+F4 hotkey combination.</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the form is a checkbox labled <strong>Show verbose tooltip help</strong>. It should be checked by default. When this checkbox is checked, WinHasher will display verbose comments in pop-up tooltip windows to help you figure out what each control does. This is can be extremely helpful for first-time users learning how the program works... or incredibly annoying for experienced users who know what they're doing. Clearing this checkbox can ease your sanity by turning the tooltips off if you find them getting in your way too much.</p>

<a name="singlefile"><h3>The Hash Single File Tab</h3></a>

<p>The <strong>Hash Single File tab</strong> allows you to compute the cryptographic hash of a single file. To select a file, either type the full path to its location in the <strong>File to Hash text box</strong>, or click the <strong>Browse button</strong> to open a file dialog and select the file from there. If you browse to find a file, its location will be populated into the File to Hash box once the browse window closes. Once a file is selected, the <strong>Compute Hash button</strong> becomes enabled. Select a hash from the <a href="#commongui">Hash drop-down</a> and click this button, and the computed hash will appear in the <strong>Hash text box</strong>. To hash a different file, repeat the same process for each file that you want to hash. If for some reason an error occurs, the File to Hash box will clear and the Compute Hash button will become disabled.</p>
<p>In general, computing the hash of a single file is a quick operation. However, note that the larger the file is, the longer it will take to compute its hash. The size of the file should not cause any problems; WinHasher streams the file once it opens it, so it can be of any arbitrary length. However, if there's a lot of data to hash, it will take longer to get the result.</p>
<p>While performing the hash, WinHasher displays a small <strong>progress dialog box</strong> showing how far along the hash is. There is a <strong>Cancel button</strong> on this dialog; click this button will abort the hashing process. The dialog will disappear when the hash is complete.</p>
<p>As a convenience, if you need to validate a hash from another source, such as a website, e-mail, or other location, you can copy and paste that hash into the <strong>Compare To text box</strong>. WinHasher will compare its generated hash with the hash in this box to determine if they match.</p>

<a name="comparetab"><h3>The Compare Files Tab</h3></a>

<p>The <strong>Compare Files tab</strong> allows you to compute the hashes of several files at once and automatically compare the hashes to see if the files are the same. Note that files are considered "the same" only if their binary contents compute to the same hash. Thus, the file's name, location, and time stamp are unimportant; only its contents are compared. The individual hashes for each file are not displayed. Instead, a summary dialog appears, indicating whether the files match or not. Note that this is an all or nothing comparison: If every file in the list computes to the same hash, then they are all said to match; if at least one file has a hash different from the rest, then <em>all</em> the files fail. For this comparison, which hash you choose is largely unimportant, but a general rule of thumb is that the more bits that are available in the hash, the less likely it will be that you'll hit upon a collision (i.e. an artificial false-positive match).</p>
<p>To start comparing files, click the <strong>Add button</strong> in the bottom left corner of the tab. A file dialog will appear where you can select one or more files. Note that you can select as many files as you want in this dialog. When you click the <strong>Open button</strong>, the file dialog goes away and the selected files are added to the <strong>Files to Compare list box</strong>. To add more files, click Add again, select more files, and click Open. Note that a file with a given name and path can only be added to the list once; if a duplicate file is added, it is silently dropped. (Files with the same name but different paths are not considered duplicates.) If you want to remove one or more files, click the file's name in the Files to Compare list box. You can use the standard Shift+Click or Control+Click combinations to select multiple files at once. When at least one file is selected, the <strong>Remove button</strong> becomes enabled. (The Remove button becomes disabled when no files are selected in the list.) Click the Remove button to remove the files from the list. Repeat this process of adding and removing files until you have the complete list of files you want to compare. As a shortcut, you can clear the entire list with one click of the <strong>Clear List button</strong>.</p>
<p>Once your list is complete, select the hash to use with the <a href="#commongui">Hash drop-down</a>. The <strong>Compare Hashes button</strong> should become enabled if two or more files are in the list box. (If the list is empty or there's only one file, this button will become disabled.) Click this button to generate and compare the hashes. Note that this operation could take a long time, and the wait will grow longer depending on the number and size of the files being compared. A <strong>progress dialog box</strong> will appear, indicating how many files have been successfully compared so far. It also contains a <strong>Cancel button</strong> to allow you to abort the comparison. Once the comparison is complete, a resul dialog box will appear with the result. Remember, this is an all-or-nothing comparison; either they all match, or they all don't.</p>

<a name="hashtext"><h3>The Hash Text Tab</h3></a>

<p>The <strong>Hash Text tab</strong> allows you to enter aribrary text into a text box and compute the hash of it. This feature was added primarily because one of my favorite <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> extensions that performed the same function ceased development and I had to abandon it. I used that extension frequently to produce "strong" passwords from simpler text, and without it I was pretty much stuck. I threw this functionality into WinHasher because the framework was already in place and other people might find it useful.</p>
<p>At the top of this tab is the <strong>Text to Hash text box</strong>. Surprisingly enough, this is where you want to put the text that you want to hash. Beneath it is the <strong>Encoding drop-down list</strong>. This lets you specify what text encoding was used for the entered text. Many different text encodings exist; this drop-down should be populated with all available encodings on your system, with the system default initially selected. Once the text has been entered and the encoding selected, click the <strong>Hash button</strong> to generate the hash of the text, which will appear in the text box below.</p>
<p>I may be mistaken, but it could be that the choice of encoding may be unnecessary. I think .NET converts all text to Unicode when used in the <code>System.String</code> object. However, changing the encoding could be useful in the situation described above: generating "strong" passwords by hashing simpler plaintext phrases. One might, for example, change the encoding to something totally different than the original text; say if the input was Unicode, switch to IBM EBCDIC (Japanese)) to produce something unexpected. For this reason, I've left the encoding choice in on the off-chance someone other than me might find this useful.</p>

<a name="dragndrop"><h3>Drag-and-Drop in WinHasher</h3></a>

<p>WinHasher supports dragging and dropping of files. Instead of going through the various buttons in the interface, you can drag files from Windows Explorer into WinHasher. The action to be performed depends on which tab is active at the time, so make sure to select the tab of the operation you want before you drop your files.</p>
<p>If you drop a single file on the <a href="#singlefile">Hash Single File tab</a>, that file's location will be populated in the File to Hash text box and the hash specified in the <a href="#commongui">Hash drop-down</a> will be automatically computed. To use a different hashing algorithm, change the hash in the Hash drop-down and click the Compute Hash button. If you drop multiple files into this tab, it will produce an error, as this tab only works on one file at a time.</p>
<p>If you drop one or more files onto the <a href="#comparetab">Compare Files tab</a>, the files' paths will be added to the Files to Compare list box. Duplicate paths are silently dropped. Files that are already in the list are preserved, so you can drag and drop files from various locations and slowly build up your list without clearing it. Removing files operates as described above. Once the list is ready, you can click the Compare Hashes button to compare the files.</p>
<p>Drag and drop is not currently enabled for the <a href="#hashtext">Hash Text tab</a>. Copy and paste text into the text box to hash large portions of text.</p>

<a name="savesettings"><h3>Remembering Your Preferences</h3></a>

<p>Starting with version 1.4, WinHasher (on Windows, at least) saves a small bit of preference information to the Windows registry. It will remember the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last tab used;</li>
<li>The last hashing algorithm used;</li>
<li>The output format used;</li>
<li>The last text encoding (on the Hash Text tab) used;</li>
<li>The last folder or directory used for browsing files;</li>
<li>The show tooltips setting;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the installer to install WinHasher, you can also use the uninstall feature to delete these preferences from the registry when the program is uninstalled. You may also elect to leave these preferences in place if you plan to reinstall WinHasher later. Note that these preferences are only removed for the user who runs the uninstaller; if more than one user on the system has run WinHasher, the other user's preferences are not deleted.</p>
